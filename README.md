## Hi there 👋

I'm Reza, a father and a Software Engineer with a passion for building impactful things.

I'm currently on a short career break since my last role at [AccelByte](https://accelbyte.io/) in Nov 2025, but I'm looking to get back in the game in early 2026.

What I'm into:
- Building scalable web apps/services (especially backend, with microservices architecture, deployed on cloud platform)
- Solving real world problems
- Learning how something works (and how to break it)
- Remote working (I can organize myself pretty well, and I like clear & concise communication)
- 🍜 Indomie (with 2 tablespoons of rice)
- Embedded systems and IoT (I'm good at soldering too, trust me)
