## Hi there 👋

I'm Reza, a father and a Software Engineer with a passion for building impactful things.

What I'm into:
- Building scalable software product/web apps/services (especially backend)
- Solving real world problems
- Learning how something works (and how to break it)
- Remote working (I like clear & concise communication)
- Embedded systems and IoT (I'm good at soldering too, trust me)
- 🍜+🍚
